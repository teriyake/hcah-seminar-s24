      <h1 class="sans">Virtual Bodies: Digitally Mediated Performance</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">HCAH Student Seminar | Spring 2024</p>
      <section>
        <h2 class="sans">Description</h2>
        <p>
          This is a seminar; it is also a workshop, laboratory, and playground
          where the cohort engage in collaborative artistic exploration with
          each other. This seminar will explore the intersection of performance
          art, sound, and technology. Through readings, discussions, and
          creative exercises, we will investigate the artistic potential of
          digital technologies, as well as the ethical implications and
          socio-political potentiality through the lens of Posthumanism and
          Whitehead’s process ontology.<br>We will begin by considering the concept
          of the "virtual" as it relates to performance art, drawing on the
          philosophical work of Gilles Deleuze and Henri Bergson. In common
          parlance, “virtual” is often synonymous with “digital,” which implies
          a cartesian disembodiment. However, we will critically examine this
          opposition between virtuality and embodiment and seek ways to bridge
          the two in the process of artistic inquiry.<br>Next, we will explore the
          role of sound in performance art, looking at how sound can be used to
          create atmosphere, embodiment, and transformation, both within and as
          a performance. We will examine the use of generative music made with
          modular synthesizers, among other sound design techniques, and
          consider how these elements can work in tandem with performance art in
          a multidisciplinary conversation. Potential workshops may take place
          in the Studio for Electronic Art (VCAM 202).<br>We will also examine the
          use of new technologies in performance art, including virtual
          environments (AR/VR), machine learning, and artificial intelligence. <label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

          <span class="sidenote">Depending on the cohort’s level of expertise in computer science, this topic may be modified to replace program 
implementations with tutorials on some intuitive programming interfaces such as PureData and Max/MSP.</span> We will explore how these technologies can be used to create new
          possibilities for embodied experiences, while also acknowledging their
          limitations and ethical implications.<br>A central focus throughout the
          seminar is the relationship between virtuality, embodiment, and
          identity, particularly how these themes intersect with social and
          political issues. We will examine the works of contemporary artists
          who explore these themes through their performances, such as Stelarc,
          LaTurbo Avedon, and others.<br>The seminar will culminate in a
          collaborative multi-media performance art installation to be presented
          to the campus community and/or beyond.<br>In this seminar, performance
          art is not only the topic of research but also the methodology—each
          session will be primarily centered on embodied explorations. No prior experience with
          performance art is necessary, and the seminar activities will be
          modified should there be a need to accommodate different abilities.
          Given the interdisciplinary nature of the topic, this seminar will
          appeal to students from a wide variety of disciplines, including
          History of Art, Visual Studies, Fine Arts, Music, Computer Science,
          Anthropology, Sociology, Philosophy, etc.
