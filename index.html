        <h2 class="sans">Description</h2>
        <p>
          This is a seminar; it is also a workshop, laboratory, and playground
          where the cohort engage in collaborative artistic exploration with
          each other. This seminar will explore the intersection of performance
          art, sound, and technology. Through readings, discussions, and
          creative exercises, we will investigate the artistic potential of
          digital technologies, as well as the ethical implications and
          socio-political potentiality through the lens of Posthumanism and
          Whitehead’s process ontology.<br />We will begin by considering the
          concept of the "virtual" as it relates to performance art, drawing on
          the philosophical work of Gilles Deleuze and Henri Bergson. In common
          parlance, “virtual” is often synonymous with “digital,” which implies
          a cartesian disembodiment. However, we will critically examine this
          opposition between virtuality and embodiment and seek ways to bridge
          the two in the process of artistic inquiry.<br />Next, we will explore
          the role of sound in performance art, looking at how sound can be used
          to create atmosphere, embodiment, and transformation, both within and
          as a performance. We will examine the use of generative music made
          with modular synthesizers, among other sound design techniques, and
          consider how these elements can work in tandem with performance art in
          a multidisciplinary conversation. Potential workshops may take place
          in the Studio for Electronic Art (VCAM 202).<br />We will also examine
          the use of new technologies in performance art, including virtual
          environments (AR/VR), machine learning, and artificial
          intelligence.<label

            class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
          ></label
          ><input
            type="checkbox"
            id="sn-artificial-intelligence"
            class="margin-toggle"
          /><span class="sidenote"
            >Depending on the cohort’s level of expertise in computer science,
            this topic may be modified to replace program implementations with
            tutorials on some intuitive programming interfaces such as PureData
            and Max/MSP.</span
          >
          We will explore how these technologies can be used to create new
          possibilities for embodied experiences, while also acknowledging their
          limitations and ethical implications.<br />A central focus throughout
          the seminar is the relationship between virtuality, embodiment, and
          identity, particularly how these themes intersect with social and
          political issues. We will examine the works of contemporary artists
          who explore these themes through their performances, such as Stelarc,
          LaTurbo Avedon, and others.<br />The seminar will culminate in a
          collaborative multi-media performance art installation to be presented
          to the campus community and/or beyond.<br />In this seminar,
          performance art is not only the topic of research but also the
          methodology—each session will be primarily centered on embodied
          explorations. No prior experience with performance art is necessary,
          and the seminar activities will be modified should there be a need to
          accommodate different abilities. Given the interdisciplinary nature of
          the topic, this seminar will appeal to students from a wide variety of
          disciplines, including History of Art, Visual Studies, Fine Arts,
          Music, Computer Science, Anthropology, Sociology, Philosophy, etc.
